# Order & Payment Management API

A Laravel 12 based REST API for managing **Orders** and **Payments**, built with clean code principles and extensibility in mind.  

The project demonstrates:  
- Repository Pattern for data access  
- Strategy Pattern for payment gateways  
- JWT Authentication (using tymon/jwt-auth)  
- Orders & Payments modules (models, migrations, controllers, services)  
- Unit & Feature Tests (`tests/Unit`, `tests/Feature`)  
- SQLite in-memory config for fast testing (`phpunit.xml`)  
- Postman collection included (`postman/collection.json`)
